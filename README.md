# First_Test_Third_Party_APIs
A simple task board application that allows a team to manage project tasks by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

To use this application, go to the index.html file and open it in your local browser. Then, you should be able to naviage to the Task Board and click the add task button. From there, you can give your task a title, date when you'd like to complete it, and a description of the task itself. Once you hit save, the task will be added to the To-Do section of the Task Board. 

You may then choose to drag the task to the In Progress section or the Done section. If your task is arriving close to the due date, it will turn yellow. If the task is past the due date you set, it will turn red.

And from there, it's up to you on how to best use this application.
